# urdu-media-ai-utils
A collection of modular tools and scripts for processing Urdu media using AI, including OCR for scanned PDFs, polygon-based annotation utilities, YouTube video downloading, and end-to-end Selenium testing for Urdu language platforms. Designed for research automation and production-ready Urdu media workflows.

This repository contains code-only implementations of selected modules I developed as part of a broader Urdu media analysis system. 

This repository focuses on:

- üßæ OCR and Annotation Utilities for Urdu scanned book pages

- üìπ YouTube Video Downloading for offline media processing

- üß™ End-to-End Selenium Testing for verifying multi-user functionality

Each module is self-contained, with:

- Its own README file

- Clear setup and usage instructions

- Example configurations or scripts to help you run it independently

 üîç These tools were developed primarily for OCR, Urdu News Processing, and automated testing workflows ‚Äî and can serve as strong templates or foundations for similar projects involving annotation, media automation, and testing.
